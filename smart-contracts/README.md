# CoinFlip

CoinFlip is an on-chain dApp that allows users to place bets with ETH and predict the outcome of a coin flip. This project is a demonstration of my progress in smart contract development, leveraging Chainlinkâ€™s VRF for provably fair randomness.

## Testing

Tests Included

1.	Minimum Bet Revert
    - Test that a bet below the minimum amount causes a revert.
    -  Expectation: CoinFlip__BetIsBelowMinimumAmount.
2.	Active Bet Revert
    - Test that a new bet while having an unresolved bet causes a revert.
    - Expectation: CoinFlip__ExistingBetIsInProgress.
3.	Insufficient Contract Balance Revert
    - Test that a bet causing the contract balance to be insufficient for payout causes a revert.
    - Expectation: CoinFlip__InsufficientFundsForPayout.
4.	Successful Bet
    - Test that a valid bet is placed correctly and the random number request is processed.
5.	Winning Bet Handling
    - Test that a user placing a winning bet receives the correct payout.
6.	Losing Bet Handling
    - Test that a user placing a losing bet does not receive a payout.
7.	Owner Withdrawal
    - Test that only the contract owner can withdraw funds and non-owners cannot.
